Description
-----------
OasisMove is a high-level/high-performance open-source Navier-Stokes solver for fluid flow in rigid and moving domains
written in Python/[FEniCS](https://fenicsproject.org/), and is an extension of the computational fluid dynamics (CFD)
solver [Oasis](https://github.com/mikaem/Oasis). In OasisMove the Navier-Stokes equations are expressed in the arbitrary
Lagrangian-Eulerian formulation, which is suitable for handling moving domains. This moving domain solver has undergone
rigorous verification and validation, and results have shown that OasisMove follows theoretical convergence rates, begin
second order accurate in time, and second and third order accurate in space with P1/P1 and P2/P1 finite elements.
Although OasisMove was developed with cardiovascular flows in mind, it is applicable to several flow problems within
CFD.

    velocity, and on the right the L2 error for the pressure, both following theoretical convergence rates. 
    The solid lines represent the simulation results, and the dashed lines display the theoretical convergence rates. 
    A similar study was performed to address temporal convergence, resulting in second order convergence (not shown here).

Installation
------------
OasisMove and its dependencies can be installed using either `conda`, or by building and running a `Docker` container,
and `pip`. For detailed installation notes see
the [installation guidelines](https://kvslab.github.io/OasisMove/installation.html).

Documentation
-------------
OasisMove's documentation is hosted [here](https://kvslab.github.io/OasisMove). This includes
multiple [demos](https://kvslab.github.io/OasisMove/tutorials.html), meant to guide the user through the basic steps of
performing a computational fluid dynamic simulation and creating problem files.
