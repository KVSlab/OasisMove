# Tutorials

These tutorials are meant to guide the user through the basic steps of
performing a computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulation in OasisMove. 
It will give a short introduction and problem description, and visualize what the expected output from each simulation.
The tutorials will also highlight different features and tweaks of OasisMove in order to improve generalization of the problems. 

We assume that you have OasisMove installed, meaning you have a working
version of *FEniCS* on your computer. It is also
beneficial, but not necessary, that you are familiar with the
[ParaView](https://www.paraview.org/) visualization software, which we
will frequently be using to visualize the geometries and results.
