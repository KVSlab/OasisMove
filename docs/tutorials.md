# Tutorials

These tutorials are meant to guide the user through the basic steps of
performing a computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulation in a vascular
body. The tutorials are divided into two main problems where we will first
consider a model of the [internal carotid
artery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_carotid_artery) (ICA)
with an aneurysm, followed by a model of the [left
atrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrium_(heart)). For the ICA, we
will demonstrate different approaches for meshing and pre-processing of
the model, followed by a CFD simulation using the Oasis software, before
post-processing the results. For the left atrium model, we will
investigate local refinement in a user-defined region, also followed by
CFD simulation and post-processing of the results.

We assume that you have VaMPy installed, meaning you have a working
version of *morphMan* and *Oasis* on your computer. It is also
beneficial, but not necessary, that you are familiar with the
[ParaView](https://www.paraview.org/) visualization software, which we
will frequently be using to visualize the geometries and results.
