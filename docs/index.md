# OasisMove â€“ A verified and validated FEniCS-based computational fluid dynamics solver for moving domains

[OasisMove](https://github.com/KVSlab/OasisMove) is a high-level/high-performance open-source Navier-Stokes solver
written in Python/[FEniCS](https://fenicsproject.org/), and is an extension of the computational fluid dynamics (CFD)
solver [Oasis](https://github.com/mikaem/Oasis). In OasisMove the Navier-Stokes equations are expressed in the arbitrary
Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) formulation, which is suitable for handling moving domains. Through verification the solver has
shown to follow theoretical convergence rates, begin second order accurate in time, and second and third order accurate
in space with $\mathbb{P_1}/\mathbb{P_1}$ and $\mathbb{P_2}/\mathbb{P_1}$ finite elements. Through validation the solver has showed good agreement with existing
benchmark results, and demonstrates the ability of the solver to capture vortex patterns in transitional and
turbulent-like flow regimes.
