# Tutorials

Running simulations in OasisMove is performed using a solver based on a incremental pressure correction scheme, as
presented in {cite}`simo1994unconditional`. The solver is intended for transient flows in moving domains, and
implemented in the [NSfracStepMove.py](https://github.com/KVSlab/OasisMove/blob/master/oasis/NSCoupled.py) Python file.
Problems are solved by running ``NSfracStepMove``, or by using
the [oasism](https://github.com/KVSlab/OasisMove/blob/master/oasis/run_oasis.py) executable. A problem keyword is
required plus any other recognized parameters.

## The Moving Vortex problem

To demonstrate how to run problems with OasisMove, we will consider a two-dimensional moving vortex problem inspired by
the Taylor-Green vortex problem (
see [problems/NSfracStep/MovingVortex.py](https://github.com/KVSlab/OasisMove/blob/master/oasis/problems/NSfracStep/MovingVortex.py)
. The problem has an analytical solution of the two-dimensional incompressible Navierâ€“Stokes equations in the absence of
body forces, $\mathbf{f} = 0$`, namely

```{math}
:label: eq-vortex
\begin{align}
    \mathbf u(\mathbf x,t) &= (-\sin (2\pi  x_2), \sin(2\pi x_1))e^{-4\nu \pi^2 t}\\
    p(\mathbf x,t) &= -\cos(2\pi x_1)\cos(2\pi x_2)e^{-8\nu \pi^2 t}
\end{align}
```

where $\mathbf x = (x_1, x_2)$ are the Euclidean coordinates, and $\nu = 0.025$ $\text{m}^2$/s. Furthermore, the mesh
velocity $\mathbf w$ is determined by the following displacement field:

```{math}
:label: eq-vortex-d
    \begin{align}
    \mathbf x(\mathbf \chi,t) &= \mathbf \chi + A \sin \left(\frac{2 \pi t}{T_G}\right) \left(\sin\left(2\pi \frac{\chi_2 + L / 2}{L}\right),\sin\left(2\pi \frac{\chi_1 + L / 2}{L}\right)\right)\\
    \mathbf w (\mathbf \chi, t) &= \frac{\partial \mathbf x}{\partial t}
    \end{align}
```

where $\mathbf \chi = (\chi_1, \chi_2)$ are the ALE coordinates, $A=0.08$ is the amplitude, $T_G=4T$ is the period
length of the mesh motion, $T$ is the length of one cycle, and :math:$L=1$. To simulate this flow problem in OasisMove
you can simply type::

``` console
$ oasism NSfracStepMove problem=MovingVortex
```

or as an alternative::

``` console
$ python NSfracStepMove.py problem=MovingVortex
```

and the simulation will start. When the simulation is finished, there will be a folder named `results_moving_vortex`,
which contains all simulation results per run. Running the moving vortex problem should produce the following velocity
field, here visualized in [ParaView](https://www.paraview.org/) over four snapshots from $T=0.25$ to $T=1$.
