# Vortex problem with oscillating boundaries

In this tutorial we will consider a two-dimensional moving vortex problem inspired by the Taylor-Green vortex problem,
introduced in {cite}`hesthaven2007nodal`. The problem is implemented in the
file [MovingVortex.py](https://github.com/KVSlab/OasisMove/blob/main/src/oasismove/problems/NSfracStep/MovingVortex.py),
but note that it has not been optimized for parallelization because of its intended use for code verification.

## Problem description

The problem has an analytical solution of the two-dimensional incompressible Navierâ€“Stokes equations in the absence of
body forces, $\mathbf{f} = 0$, namely:

```{math}
:label: eq-vortex
\begin{align}
    \mathbf u(\mathbf x,t) &= (-\sin (2\pi  x_2), \sin(2\pi x_1))e^{-4\nu \pi^2 t}\\
    p(\mathbf x,t) &= -\cos(2\pi x_1)\cos(2\pi x_2)e^{-8\nu \pi^2 t}
\end{align}
```

where $\mathbf x = (x_1, x_2)$ are the Euclidean coordinates, and $\nu = 0.025$ $\text{m}^2$/s. Furthermore, the mesh
velocity $\mathbf w$ is determined by the following displacement field:

```{math}
:label: eq-vortex-d
    \begin{align}
    \mathbf x(\mathbf \chi,t) &= \mathbf \chi + A_0 \sin \left(\frac{2 \pi t}{T_G}\right) \left(\sin\left(2\pi \frac{\chi_2 + L / 2}{L}\right),\sin\left(2\pi \frac{\chi_1 + L / 2}{L}\right)\right)\\
    \mathbf w (\mathbf \chi, t) &= \frac{\partial \mathbf x}{\partial t}
    \end{align}
```

where $\mathbf \chi = (\chi_1, \chi_2)$ are the ALE coordinates, $A_0=0.08$ is the amplitude, $T_G=4T$ is the period
length of the mesh motion, $T$ is the length of one cycle, and $L=1$.

## Simulation in OasisMove

To simulate this flow problem in OasisMove using the default parameters you can run the following command:

``` console
$ oasism NSfracStepMove problem=MovingVortex 
```

and the simulation will start. The simulation should only take a couple of seconds when running with the default
parameters, as it is run on a relatively coarse mesh for only 20 time steps.

## Results

When the simulation is finished, there will be a folder named `results_moving_vortex`, in the current working directory.
The results-folder contains all simulation results per run. Running the moving vortex problem with the default
parameters should produce three solution files located in the `Solutions`
folder: `velocity.xdmf`, `pressure.xdmf`, and the exact velocity solution `velocity_exact.xdmf`. These solution files
can be visualized in [ParaView](https://www.paraview.org/) or any similar visualization software, and in
{numref}`vel-vortex` we display the displaced grid, velocity and pressure solution at $T=1$.

## Increasing the spatial and temporal resolution

The default resolution for the vortex problem is using the resolution parameters $N_x=20$ and $N_y=20$ resulting in
$2\times N_x \times N_y = 800$ triangular cells in the mesh. To increase the mesh resolution, we can supply these
parameters as command-line arguments to change their value. For instance, to create a mesh consisting of 20000 cells, we
can run the following command:

``` console
$ oasism NSfracStepMove problem=MovingVortex Nx=100 Ny=100
```

Similarly, we can adjust the number of time steps the simulation should perform by adjusting the time step
parameter `dt`, which by default is $\Delta t = 5\cdot 10^{-2}$. To simulate 1000 time steps between $t=0$ and $t=T=1$,
we can run the following command:

``` console
$ oasism NSfracStepMove problem=MovingVortex T=1 dt=0.001
```

```{important}
When adjusting spatial and temporal resolution is important to know relationship between the cell size and the time-step size, which are closely related through the Courant number ($C$) given by the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) condition:
     
$$
\begin{align}
C ={\frac  {u\,\Delta t}{\Delta x}} < C_{\max },
\end{align}
$$
where $u$ is the velocity magnitude, $\Delta t$ is the time step size, and $\Delta x$ is the length interval. The general consensus is that $C_{\max} = 1$.
